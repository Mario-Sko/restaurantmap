written in React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML

The project covers

- A Google Maps map loaded with the Google Maps API
- A list of restaurants on the right side of the page that are within the area displayed on the map
- When you click on a restaurant, the list of reviews should be shown. Also show the Google Street View photo
- Add a review about an existing restaurant (The information will not be saved if they leave the page)
- A filter tool allows the display of restaurants that have between X and Y stars. The map should be updated in real-time to show the  corresponding restaurants.
